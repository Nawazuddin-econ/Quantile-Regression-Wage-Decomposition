# Quantile-Regression-Wage-Decomposition
This repository contains Stata codes for estimating wage differentials at different quantiles.
It is part of my ongoing work, where I am estimating socio-religious-community-wise wage differences. However, the wage differential can be produced for other comparison groups, such as male and female, rural and urban, etc.

In this repository, you will find codes related to NSS EUS 61st Round (2004-2005). However, the same procedure can be applied to other survey rounds or household surveys where wage data is available.

The files show how to produce raw wage gap estimates, K-density, Quantile Regression, and Quantile-based wage decomposition.

As I mentioned, this is ongoing work (since 2022, and I don't know when it will be finished). I have multiple versions of this work. Therefore, this repository should not be considered a replication package of the proposed work.

This repository will assist students and early-career researchers in the field of labor economics.
